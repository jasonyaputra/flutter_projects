# flutter_projects

folders without the name "project" is just me playing around with dart trying out how widget works and stuff.

For calculator app:
The buttons/ (logic of the app) is not really 100% implemented such as the "()" and "+/-" button, because its quite complicated to implement and my focus was really more into how to make the UI of the app using widgets, how widgets works, and widget properties.
